                    Now, we know that humans are nothing short of creative. Although most of this creativity is
                    manifested in
                    music, paintings, movies, and books, crimes also get some of the creative action. People have
                    gotten
                    arrested
                    for so many types of crimes in history, and some people like to stand apart from others. A-EZ

                    During a ride on a commuter train, Austin Shurbutt was caught on video trying to steal a
                    wheelchair
                    that
                    was in use by an elderly woman. Shurbutt, 26, was wearing reindeer slippers and a holiday red
                    sweatshirt
                    during the attack, Fox 10 Phoenix reports. We can take a wild guess that this man will be on

                    Rebecca Taylor, a 49-year-old Texas woman, was accused of trying to buy another woman’s baby at

                    self-checkout
                    line in Walmart, according to NBC News. Taylor offered hundreds of thousands of dollars for the
                    child. As
                    the mother resisted, Taylor continued to insist, while raising her offer. She even followed the
                    mother and
                    child into the parking lot.
                    <br><br>
                    Taylor and a female companion began calling out to the baby by his name, even though the mother
                    never told
                    them it. Taylor was charged with the offense of the sale or purchase of a child, and she has
                    gone
                    down in
                    history for committing one of the weirdest crimes in Walmart to date.

                    the New York Post states. They were originally charged with obscenity, which was later dropped

                    charged with vandalism instead. The church burned down the altar after this act, to cleanse
